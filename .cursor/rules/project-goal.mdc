# Project Goal

The Dialysis PDMS is a **learning platform**. The goal is to:

1. **Understand healthcare systems** – How EHRs, HIS, LIS, PDMS, and integration engines interact
2. **Understand dialysis domain** – Workflows, vitals, sessions, hypotension, clinical processes
3. **Understand FHIR** – How FHIR enables interoperability in such systems
4. **Apply .NET/C#** – Build and evolve a real system using .NET technologies and FHIR (e.g. Firely SDK)

**Approach:** Theory first for onboarding, then learn by doing through implementation. Each feature should reinforce understanding of healthcare, dialysis, and FHIR.
