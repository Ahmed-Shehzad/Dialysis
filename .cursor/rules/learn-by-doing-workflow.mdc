# Learn-by-Doing Workflow

When developing features or systems, follow this three-phase process:

## Phase 1: Plan It

Before writing code, articulate the design with workflows and diagrams.

- **Capture workflows** – Describe the flow of data, actors, and steps.
- **Use Mermaid diagrams** – Create visual representations for:
  - Sequence diagrams (actor interactions)
  - Flowcharts (decision flows)
  - Entity-relationship or component diagrams
- **Output** – Planning doc (e.g. in `docs/` or `*.md`) with Mermaid blocks.

```mermaid

    A[Request] --> B[Handler]
    B --> C[Domain]
    C --> D[Persistence]
```

## Phase 2: Implement It

Build the feature according to the plan.

- **Implement** – Write the code, tests, and infrastructure.
- **Document in WIKI** – After implementation, update WIKI docs describing:
  - What was built
  - How to use it (APIs, endpoints, config)
  - Where key logic lives
- **Output** – Working code + WIKI documentation.

## Phase 3: Explanation (System Architecture Updates)

Update the system architecture to reflect what exists.

- **Update architecture docs** – Add or refine:
  - Component diagrams
  - Data flow
  - Module boundaries
  - New integrations
- **Keep architecture in sync** – Ensure diagrams match implemented reality.
- **Output** – Updated architecture documentation (e.g. `docs/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `healthcare_systems_&_dialysis_architecture.md`).

## Summary

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1. Plan | Articulate workflows, draw Mermaid diagrams | Planning doc |
| 2. Implement | Build it, then document in WIKI | Code + WIKI |
| 3. Explain | Update system architecture docs | Architecture updates |
