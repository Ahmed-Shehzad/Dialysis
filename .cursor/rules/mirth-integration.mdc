## Mirth Connect (Integration Engine)

**Mirth** (NextGen Connect) handles:
- Connectivity: MLLP, SFTP, file, REST
- Transformation: HL7 parsing, field mapping, format conversion
- Routing: ADT→EHR, ORU→lab, dialysis→FHIR
- Reliability: Queue, retries, dead-letter, monitoring

**Dialysis PDMS** (.NET) handles:
- Domain logic, FHIR modeling, validation
- Clinical workflows (hypotension prediction, alerting)
- Audit, provenance, consent

### Implications

- Do not implement MLLP listeners, file watchers, or SFTP in .NET for HL7 ingestion.
- Expose REST APIs for Mirth to call.
- APIs must accept JSON payloads that Mirth can produce (e.g. `hl7/stream` with rawMessage, `vitals/ingest` with readings).
- Include `X-Tenant-Id` and JWT Bearer in API contracts for Mirth destinations.
