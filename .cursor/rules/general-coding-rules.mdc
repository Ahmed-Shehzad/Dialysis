# General Coding Rules

## Variable Names & Style
- Use explicit, descriptive variable names over short, ambiguous ones
- Follow consistent coding style; adhere to existing project conventions

## Priorities
- **Performance**: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable
- **Security**: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes
- **Test Coverage**: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code

## Error Handling & Logging
- Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary

## Design
- **Modular Design**: Encourage modular design principles for maintainability and reusability
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions
- **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hardcoded values with named constants for clarity and maintainability
- **Edge Cases**: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases
- **Assertions**: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early
