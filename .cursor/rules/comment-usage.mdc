# Comment Usage

- Use comments sparingly, and when you do, make them meaningful
- Don't comment on obvious things. Excessive or unclear comments clutter the codebase and become outdated
- Use comments to convey the "why" behind specific actions or explain unusual behavior and potential pitfalls
- Provide meaningful information about the function's behavior and explain unusual behavior and potential pitfalls
